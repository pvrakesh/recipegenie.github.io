    <h2>App Tracking Transparency</h2>

    <p>Our app [Your App Name] ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to transparency regarding the collection and use of your data. In accordance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, we may request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites.</p>

    <h3>What is tracking?</h3>

    <p>Tracking refers to the act of linking user or device data collected from our app with user or device data collected from other companies' apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. It also refers to sharing user or device data with data brokers.</p>

    <h3>How we use tracking data</h3>

    <p>If you allow tracking, we may use this data for the following purposes:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Usage data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Your choices</h3>
